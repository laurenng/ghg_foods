  "One of the most glaring observations that was made during this
  investigation is the
  position of a food on the food chain. There was a clear, substantive
  increase in the
  average CO2 emissions of animal products compared to plants. This was
  especially evident
  in the cases of large animals, such as buffalo or cows, which dominated
  the CO2 emissions
  with both high averages and high outliers. These food products were
  also significantly
  more impact on the use of Land and Water in general. The amount of effort
  that must be made
  to grow a crop for the sake of using it to grow another material should
  not be understated.
  An interesting feature that was discovered was that the highest outliers
  were often in
  impoverished areas (in infrastructure and natural resources). Sub-saharan
  Africa, South Asia,
  and Australia were often at the top of the charts. Imported goods and
  specialty goods,
  such as organic or artisinal, were also more impactful in terms of
  emissions on average."

  showing all. This
  does not however, reduce the impact of the data analysis. It in fact,
  strengthens the point
  by demonstrating wide consensus thoughout all regions. Large, grazing mammals
  are simply
  worse for the enviroment. While we cannot make sweeping reccomendations, we
  can only hope
  that people can observe this data and use it to inform their life choices.
  A focus and
